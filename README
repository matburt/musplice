musplice:

Don't you wish you could have your internet radio streams automatically switch at predetermined intervals?  Say you want to listen to some music for an hour and then switch to listening to the news for 15 minutes?   I couldn't find a player that could do this so I wrote this simple Python implementation.

see the example musplice.conf which will be installed to /etc

The configuration file has two types of sections:

musplice section: which contains the configuration directive for the sound
                  device.
named section: each named section will represent a different stream name
               and contain options for the stream location, time in seconds
               to play the stream (or 'all' to play the entire stream).

You may have as many named stream sections as you want.  The player will play
each stream in sequence and start over at the beginning when the end is
reached.

There is also a very simple cli interface which takes the following commands:

q - Quit
p - Print What's Playing
n - Play Next Stream

If you are having trouble on Linux due to the crappy python-alsa module being used, you can use the Alsa wrapper utility 'aoss':

$ aoss musplice -c /etc/musplice.conf
